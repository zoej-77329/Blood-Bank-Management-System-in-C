# Blood-Bank-Management-System-in-C
The Blood Management System (BMS)helps people sign up to donate blood, registers hospitals,
manages the blood donation process, handles requests for blood, and makes sureany expired
or unusable blood gets disposed ofproperly. To keep everything safe, only the admin,who has
the right credentials, can get into the systemto change or view donor,hospital,or blood
details.People who want to donate blood need to have validDNRs and be healthy. And only 
hospitals with valid HPIDs can ask for blood from the BMS.
